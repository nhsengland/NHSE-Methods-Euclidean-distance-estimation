## NHSEI Methods: Euclidean distance estimation


### About this method

The Euclidean distance estimation method is an important statistical method which  helps to accurately measure the distance between two points based on various characteristics.
For more information about the method, including how is being used, when and by who, please refer to the Methods toolbox documentation on our [FutureNHS workspace](https://future.nhs.uk/DataMeth/grouphome).


### Requirements

Phyton packages: 'pandas','numpy'


### Summary of the code

This Python code develops the Euclidean distance calculations. Firstly, it reads and standardises the data by calculating the average and standard deviation. Then it applies a standardised value function by name and later the Euclidean distance function. Finally, it sorts the calculated distances and outputs the results.
